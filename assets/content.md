20 Types of Berries and Their Health Benefits

Blackberries

As with all berries, blackberries also contain various health-protective polyphenols.

Blackberries show a significant protective effect against LBL-oxidation, a promiment cardiovascular risk factor, in human intervention studies (6).

Studies also show that wild blackberries are 3 to 5 times higher in polyphenols, so get outside and pick your own.
